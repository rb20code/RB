# RB_File_Manage
File Manage by extension.
Here we created a python code for file management. 
In this; We have multiple files with different extensions(.pdf , .jpg , .py , .xml...) and we need only .pdf files.
This code will make the files in a suitable format like this;
File A(Source Folder): Contains 10 Extensions:
1. .jpg
2. .py
3. .pdf
4. .txt

By running this code we can easily move or copy these files in a destination folder which is provided into the code.
Then, that all 10 extension files will b generated in the main folder like this;
File B(Destination Folder): JPG(Folder Name) :- 1.jpg , 2.jpg
                            pdf(Folder Name) :- 2.pdf , 2.pdf

This is how we can manage multiple files so easily with a click.
Thank You.
