File Mnage by extention.
Here we created a python code for file management. 
In this; We have multiple files with different extentions(.pdf , .jpg , .py , .xml...) and we need only .pdf files.
This code will make the files in a suitable format like this;
File A(Source Folder): Contains 10 Extentions:
1. jpg
2. py
3. pdf
4. txt

By run this code we can easily move or copy this files in a destination folder which is provided in to the code.
Then after, that all 10 extention files will b generated in a main folder like this;
File B(Destination Folder): JPG(Folder Name) :- 1.jpg , 2.jpg
                            pdf(Folder Name) :- 2.pdf , 2.pdf
